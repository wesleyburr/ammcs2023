## Abstract

It is very common for workflows connected to mass spectrometry to be entirely contained to closed-source
software provided by instrumentation manufacturers, e.g., LECO instruments are designed to work with the ChromaTOF [1] mass spectrometry data system, and the StatCompare suite of statistical tools. These tools have many
advantages: they are professionally designed, with modern graphical interfaces; they are tested and known to
process the data types produced by the instrument; and they are standard. They also have disadvantages: the algorithms are not publicly exposed; the process is limited to the implementation; and occasionally new instruments
are released which are not supported by the current version of the software suites.
In this talk we will discuss the development of two open source tools: the subMaldi package [4] for single
dimension mass spectrometry data; and gcgcWork [2, 3] for the reproduction of a somewhat standard GCxGC
workflow and pipeline, similar to key components provided by ChromaTOF. Both are created for the R programming environment, and available on GitHub. We will discuss the issues with implementation, especially with
respect to data size and format, and lay out the challenges ahead for producing higher quality, user-friendly software for common chemical analyses. In both cases, the packages were developed to aid in the analysis of forensic
science data sets: subMaldi for dried bloodstain chemical analysis; and gcgcWork for VOC analysis from human
body decomposition.
